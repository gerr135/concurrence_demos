Initial testing code is in Family* files. This is a command-line version of basic concurrency testing.

Code was refactored to provide 2 requested implementations (via semaphores or synchronized classes).
As bunch of the functionality is the same, especially the interface, the hierarchy of classes is provided in few packages
representing entities - bank, family (parents/children), settings, etc.. the Main* classes now are top-level
buildables that provide either command line or GUI interface and invoke either semaphore-based or synchronized classes,
descendant of Abstraction for each entity..

In short:
Main* directly uses bank/parent/child.Abstraction as type and constructs the proper class as final.
